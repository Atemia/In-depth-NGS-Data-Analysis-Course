# Introduction to ChIP-Seq

<small>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments isolate the chromatin from a cell and immunoprecipitate (IP) DNA fragments bound to a protein of interest. In ChIP-Seq, the DNA fragments are sequenced, enriched regions of DNA or peaks are determined, and over-represented sequence motifs and functional annotations can be identified.</small>

---

During this session we will be performing a complete workflow for ChIP-Seq analysis, starting with experimental design and generation of the raw sequencing reads and ending with functional enrichment analyses and motif discovery.

# Experimental design and library preparation

---

Several steps are involved in the library preparation of protein-bound DNA fragments for sequencing:

> 1. After the chromatin is isolated from the cell, proteins are cross-linked to the DNA
> 2. The DNA is sheared into fragments (sonication)
> 3. A protein-specific antibody is used to immunoprecipitate the protein-bound DNA fragments
> 4. The crosslink is reversed and DNA purified
> 5. DNA fragments are size selected and amplified using PCR

</small>

Within the DNA fragments enriched for the regions binding to a protein of interest, only a fraction correspond to actual signal. The proportion of DNA fragments containing the actual binding site of the protein depends on the **number of active binding sites, the number of starting genomes, and the efficiency of the IP**.

---

In addition, when performing ChIP-Seq, some sequences may appear enriched due to the following:

- Open chromatin regions are fragmented more easily than closed regions
- Repetitive sequences might seem to be enriched (copy number inaccuracies in genome assembly)
- Uneven distribution of sequence reads across the genome

---

Therefore, proper controls are essential. A ChIP-Seq peak should be compared with the same region of the genome in a matched control.

The same starting material should be divided to be used for both the protein-specific IP and the control. The control sample can be generated by one of the following recommended techniques:

> * No IP (input DNA)
> * No antibody ("mock IP")
> * Non-specific antibody (IgG "mock IP")

# Introduction to example data

---

* Our goal for this session is to compare the the binding profiles of [Nanog](http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2009/0909/090910/full/stemcells.2009.118.html) and [Pou5f1](http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v12/n5/full/7290134a.html) (Oct4). 
* The ChIP was performed on H1 human embryonic stem cell line (h1-ESC) cells, and sequenced using Illumina. 
* The datasets were obtained from the [HAIB TFBS ENCODE collection](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeHaibTfbs/). 
* These 2 transcription factors are involved in **stem cell pluripotency** and one of the goals is to understand their roles, individually and together, in transcriptional regulation.

Two replicates were collected and each was divided into 3 aliquots for the following:

- Nanog IP
- Pou5f1 IP
- Control input DNA

---

For these 6 samples, we will be using reads from only a 32.8 Mb of chromosome 12 (chr12:1,000,000-33,800,000), so we can get through the workflow in class.

Below is the workflow that we will be using today, each step in the workflow will require the data to be in a specific type of standardized format.
